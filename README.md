Project Delphinium aims to be a thriving community of educators, developers, and designers committed to creating practical, effective, and engaging gamification environments and tools for education. The Delphinium framework allows us to contribute a wide variety of educational gamification widgets and beautifully arrange them in flexible dashboards, helping to motivate tens of thousands of students.


Please see the github wiki for installation and development guides.
