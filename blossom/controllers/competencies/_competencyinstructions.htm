		<h4>Setting up Competencies:</h4>
        <p>Using Stem create tags for assignments and quizzes.<br/>
            Tags for competencies are designated using the prefix C: followed by a name.<br/>
            Each name represents a group of assignments that belong to the competency.<br/>
            When the component runs on a page it gathers all assignments and submissions, 
			sorts them by the tag names and compares the amount completed to the total possible, 
			then presents this as percent completed for each group.
