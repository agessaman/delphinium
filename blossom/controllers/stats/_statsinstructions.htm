    <h2>Stats Component</h2>

    <div id="backend-instructions">
        <p>The stats component is tightly related to the experience component. In order for stats to work, an instance of
            experience must be configured in the
            greenhouse backend. A backend instance of stats must also be configured in greenhouse.
            <br/><b>Greenhouse-->Blossom-->Stats-->New Stats Instance</b>
        </p>
        Fill out the form accordingly:
        <div class="fillOutForm"></div>
        <br/>
        If these instances are not configured and the component is added onto a page, automatic instances of these components will
        be created on the fly, but the instructor must then configure them from the LTI inside Canvas.
    </div>
    <hr/>
</div>

<h3>There are four modules in the Stats component:</h3>
<div id="accordion">
    <h3>Pace</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Pace shows bonuses and penalties --a measure of how well students are keeping up with the red line as it
            crosses milestones. It also shows what their potential
            penalty points are if they cross the next milestone, and the potential bonuses they could earn by crossing
            the next milestone.
            <br/>Bonuses are green, and penalties are red. Potential bonuses and penalties are also green red, but are
            slightly grayed out.
            <br/>Locked in bonus and penalties use a lock icon <i class="fa fa-lock"></i>, whereas potential
            bonus/penalties are denoted by a clock icon <i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i>.
            <br/>
        </p>
        <div id="image0"></div>
    </div>
    <h3>Health</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Health shows students' current, locked-in penalty/bonus balance. If the overall balance is positive, the bar
            will be green. If the balance is
            negative, the bar will be red.
        </p>
        <div id="image1"></div>
    </div>
    <h3>Gap</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Gap shows how many points students are ahead or behind the red line. If they are ahead of the line, the bar
            will be green.
            If they are behind of the line, the bar will be red.
        </p>
        <div id="image2"></div>
    </div>
    <h3>Stamina</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Stamina is a measure of the quality of students' work. If their work quality is low, they will "run out of
            gas" early and
            not be able to reach higher milestones because they will run out of points to earn. Students can select to
            view the percent of points
            earned for all assignments they have completed so far, or just the last 10 assignments.
        </p>
